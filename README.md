# PyQt5 Python GUI
 Graphing csv files, exmaple tabs program, and simple calculator for using [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) GUI library for python. PyQt is the the python port for [Qt](https://www.qt.io), which is a set of cross-platform C++ libraries that implement high-level APIs for accessing many aspects of modern desktop and mobile systems. 
 
In the src directory there is a fbs project to create a stand alone python executable which will have matplotlib graphs within the app, though this is still a work in progress.

## graphs.py

This is a very simple graphing application, written in python. Can only accept .csv files and can only do a line plot for simple Y vs. X graphs (two variables).

## simple-calc.py

The simple-calc.py script is a simple calculator which only has basic operations available. Still a bit buggy
